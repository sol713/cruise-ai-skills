# Cruise Line Comparator

## Goal

Help cruise travelers choose the best cruise line, ship, route, or brand by ranking options against traveler fit, total trip cost, onboard style, itinerary quality, and priority tradeoffs.

## Required Inputs

Collect these before ranking:

| Input | Required | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Traveler group | Yes | Couple, solo traveler, family with teens |
| Budget range | Yes | $3,000-$4,500 total |
| Departure region or destination | Yes | Florida, Alaska, Mediterranean |
| Trip length | Yes | 5 nights, 7 nights, 10-12 nights |
| Top three priorities | Yes | Kids club, food, private island |
| Lines or ships being compared | Yes | Carnival vs Royal Caribbean |

## Optional Inputs

| Input | Why It Helps |
|---|---|
| Travel dates or season | Helps with pricing and crowd caveats |
| Cabin type | Reveals hidden cost and comfort tradeoffs |
| Dining preferences | Improves fit across casual, flexible, premium, and traditional styles |
| Entertainment preferences | Helps separate ship classes and onboard atmosphere |
| Loyalty status | May change value if benefits are meaningful |
| Tolerance for crowds | Helps compare mega-ships, older ships, and premium lines |
| Must-have ports | Prevents recommending a better ship on a weaker itinerary |

## Workflow

1. Clarify the comparison set and remove options the user is not considering.
2. Define scoring criteria from the user's top three priorities, then add baseline criteria for budget, itinerary, ship quality, cabins, food, activities, service style, and hidden costs.
3. Compare each line or ship by fit and not-fit reasons for the specific traveler group.
4. Flag hidden-cost watchouts such as gratuities, drink packages, Wi-Fi, specialty dining, port fees, transfers, kids expenses, and private-island extras.
5. Rank the options with a top recommendation, runner-up, and avoid/only-if recommendation.
6. Explain caveats where live prices, current ship condition, deployment, policy changes, or seasonal factors could change the result.
7. End with one useful CTA and conversion tags.

## Reference Files

Use these files when available:

- `references/brand-fit-matrix.md`: durable brand positioning by traveler segment, budget style, and onboard atmosphere.
- `references/comparison-scoring-rubric.md`: scorecard criteria, default weights, and ranking thresholds.
- `references/hidden-cost-watchouts.md`: cost categories and brand-specific watchouts to flag before checkout.

If the reference files are unavailable, keep the same principle: recommend the option that best fits the user's priorities and actual quoted total cost, not the most famous brand.

```

## Freshness Rules

- Treat fares, promos, onboard package prices, itinerary deployments, ship refurbishments, policy changes, and port fees as price-sensitive or live-changing information.
- Do not invent current prices, discount amounts, ship condition, or policy details. Ask for quotes or tell the user to verify with the cruise line or booking source.
- When comparing brands broadly, explain that the specific ship class and itinerary can matter more than the logo on the funnel.
- If travel dates are missing, label price and crowd guidance as directional.

## CTA Rules

- Offer one useful next step only.
- Prefer a comparison scorecard, booking research page, or modeling the same options for a different traveler profile.
- Do not include direct tracked affiliate links.
